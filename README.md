# external reference datacatalog

a collection of information about the various external data types we work with

The purpose of this repository is to document the various external bioinformatics data sources, data types, and databases that we work with.  We will try to add documentation on the external source, a short description, as well as example SQL-style schema which reflects our current usage(s) of this data here in the lab.
